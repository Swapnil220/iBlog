                </a>
                <p class="font1">Every once in a while, a convergence of knowledge, progress and will occurs, and
                    changes the course of human history.
                    I wholly believe we are on the cusp of this with quantum computing.
                    Ironically not a leap, these moments are typically an accelerating continuum, where things seemingly
                    disparate suddenly come together. People around the world have been working on different pieces of
                    the puzzle; there’s a moment where the whole jigsaw comes into view. From democracy to understanding
                    the evolution process, from fire to the internet, this has happened throughout our time on the
                    planet. How extraordinary that humans get to live through multiple moments of this kind in a normal
                    lifespan.</p>

                </a>
                <p class="font1">In June, King Yuan Electronics Co, one of the world’s largest chip-testing companies,
                    temporarily suspended operations due to COVID-19 infections at a factory in central Taiwan. The
                    technology world was already struggling with supply chain issues at the time. This exacerbated the
                    shortage of semiconductor chips which has been estimated to cost car manufacturers $210 billion in
                    revenue this year alone. The White House acknowledges that this disruption could knock one full
                    percentage point off the GDP, resulting in waves of shutdowns, and “hurt the hundreds of thousands
                    of U.S. workers employed in manufacturing jobs across the automotive and heavy trucking sectors.”

                </a>
                <p class="font1">Although major python IDEs (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, and recently DataSpell)
                    all support editing Jupyter Notebooks, JupyterLab is still my go-to IDE when I use notebooks for my
                    data science projects. As an interactive IDE, JupyterLab allows us to visualize the data (e.g.,
                    tabular data, images) step by step in a cell-based organization.</p>

                <p class="font1">We put so much pressure on ourselves as millennials.
                    We want a six figure income, the love of our life, a successful entrepreneurial side hustle, to
                    travel every few months, a stable gym routine, 7–8 hours of sleep, work/life balance and
                    mental/emotional stability.</p>

                </a>
                <p class="font1">As far as we know, there are exactly three ways that a planet can wind up possessing
                    one or more moons. The first way is from a circumplanetary disk, where the material that accrues
                    around a proto-star not only fragments into planetesimals that grow and evolve, but that the largest
                    proto-planets acquire their own disks of material around them, which leads to moons. This primarily
                    applies to gas giants, and is likely responsible for most of the moons in the Jovian, Saturnian, and
                    Uranian systems.
                    The second way is through gravitational capture, which explains moons with bizarre orbital
                    orientations and densities that don’t match up with the parent planet’s material. This applies to
                    moons like Saturn’s Phoebe or Neptune’s Triton, which likely both originated from the Kuiper belt.
                    And finally, the third way is through a major collision, which kicks up debris that coalesces into
                    one or more natural satellites: the likely origin of not only Earth’s moon, but all of the moons of
                    Pluto.</p>
