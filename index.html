            <h1>First drive: Rivian delivers the electric truck we’ve been waiting for</h1>
            <p>The 2022 Rivian R1T has a lot to like and some details to love</p>
            <p> The Rivian R1T electric truck is neither too big nor small.
                It handles rock crawling and off-camber
                trails with ease, can zip from zero to 60 miles per hour on a dirt road in just a few seconds without
                the typical back-end slippage — although there is an option to provide that drifting effect — and it can
                crank through winding mountain roads, pushing the edge of each corner without body roll.

                It’s loaded with the kind of interior and exterior touches that put it firmly in the premium zone — and
                yet the Rivian R1T is no delicate flower.

                The company’s designers and engineers helped the truck steer clear of pretension by combining form and
                function from tip to tail. Some of the added surprises — the location of functional details like
                tie-downs, an air compressor and outlets — suggest that numerous Rivian employees tested the truck in
                real-world conditions, including camping, mountain biking and even more mundane tasks like
                grocery-fetching.

                To be clear, far more time and miles are required to provide a full review. Still, as a total package,
                the Rivian R1T impresses.</p>

                </a>
                <p class="font1">Although major python IDEs (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, and recently DataSpell)
                    all support editing Jupyter Notebooks, JupyterLab is still my go-to IDE when I use notebooks for my
                    data science projects. As an interactive IDE, JupyterLab allows us to visualize the data (e.g.,
                    tabular data, images) step by step in a cell-based organization.</p>

                    We want a six figure income, the love of our life, a successful entrepreneurial side hustle, to
                    travel every few months, a stable gym routine, 7–8 hours of sleep, work/life balance and
                    mental/emotional stability.</p>

                </a>
                <p class="font1">In June, King Yuan Electronics Co, one of the world’s largest chip-testing companies,
                    temporarily suspended operations due to COVID-19 infections at a factory in central Taiwan. The
                    technology world was already struggling with supply chain issues at the time. This exacerbated the
                    shortage of semiconductor chips which has been estimated to cost car manufacturers $210 billion in
                    revenue this year alone. The White House acknowledges that this disruption could knock one full
                    percentage point off the GDP, resulting in waves of shutdowns, and “hurt the hundreds of thousands
                    of U.S. workers employed in manufacturing jobs across the automotive and heavy trucking sectors.”

                </a>
                <p class="font1">As far as we know, there are exactly three ways that a planet can wind up possessing
                    one or more moons. The first way is from a circumplanetary disk, where the material that accrues
                    around a proto-star not only fragments into planetesimals that grow and evolve, but that the largest
                    proto-planets acquire their own disks of material around them, which leads to moons. This primarily
                    applies to gas giants, and is likely responsible for most of the moons in the Jovian, Saturnian, and
                    Uranian systems.
                    The second way is through gravitational capture, which explains moons with bizarre orbital
                    orientations and densities that don’t match up with the parent planet’s material. This applies to
                    moons like Saturn’s Phoebe or Neptune’s Triton, which likely both originated from the Kuiper belt.
                    And finally, the third way is through a major collision, which kicks up debris that coalesces into
                    one or more natural satellites: the likely origin of not only Earth’s moon, but all of the moons of
                    Pluto.</p>

                </a>
                <p class="font1">Every once in a while, a convergence of knowledge, progress and will occurs, and
                    changes the course of human history.
                    I wholly believe we are on the cusp of this with quantum computing.
                    Ironically not a leap, these moments are typically an accelerating continuum, where things seemingly
                    disparate suddenly come together. People around the world have been working on different pieces of
                    the puzzle; there’s a moment where the whole jigsaw comes into view. From democracy to understanding
                    the evolution process, from fire to the internet, this has happened throughout our time on the
                    planet. How extraordinary that humans get to live through multiple moments of this kind in a normal
                    lifespan.</p>
